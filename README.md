```

## Configuration

There are a coupple of ways that you can change configuration values. The first of those ways is changing values within `config.mjs`, this is the easiest way to change values. The second way is to use the coressponding environment variables. Both ways do the same thing but have their own use cases.

`config.mjs`
```js
import "dotenv/config";

export default {
  ip: process.env.IP, // IP of the server
  port: process.env.PORT || 8080 // Port of the server
}
```

`.env`
```
IP=127.0.0.1
PORT=80
```
